The analysis presented herein seeks to compare the academic performance of students in an examination conducted in the years 2020 and 2024. The primary objective is to delve into the dataset characteristics and elucidate key statistical measures, including mean, standard deviation, and percentile, to discern any disparities in performance between the two years.


For this analysis, I employed the Python programming language, utilizing the NumPy library to handle and process the datasets containing the exam scores for the respective years. The methodology adopted involved the calculation of mean, standard deviation, and 90th percentile for both datasets. Subsequently, I utilized Matplotlib to visualize the frequency distributions of the exam scores through the creation of histograms.
Results and Analysis:
2020 Dataset:
Mean: 60.7067
Standard Deviation: 14.3919
90th Percentile: 90.0
Upon analyzing the 2020 dataset, it is evident that the mean score lies around 60.7067. This indicates the average performance of students in the examination. The standard deviation of 14.3919 suggests a considerable spread of scores around the mean, indicating the degree of variability in student performance. Furthermore, the 90th percentile score of 90.0 delineates the score below which 90% of students fall.
2024 Dataset:
Mean: 67.1821
Standard Deviation: 13.2516
90th Percentile: 85.0
Conversely, the analysis of the 2024 dataset unveils a higher mean score of 67.1821 compared to 2020. This implies an improvement in the overall performance of students. However, the standard deviation of 13.2516 indicates a narrower spread of scores around the mean, suggesting a more uniform distribution of performance. Additionally, the 90th percentile score of 85.0 signifies a lower top performance threshold compared to 2020.


A comparative examination of the two datasets reveals discernible disparities in performance metrics. While the mean score is higher in 2024, indicating an improvement in overall performance, the narrower spread of scores and lower top performance threshold suggest a more concentrated distribution of scores compared to 2020.
